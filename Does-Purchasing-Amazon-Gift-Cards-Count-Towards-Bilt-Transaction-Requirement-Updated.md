## Understanding Bilt Transaction Requirements

Bilt has specific criteria to earn points on purchases. These conditions vary based on your spending habits and payment methods.

**Key Bilt Transaction Rules:**

- You must make a minimum of five transactions per statement cycle to earn points.
- Some transactions may not qualify, depending on merchant categorization.
- Gift card purchases may be flagged as non-qualifying transactions.

To fully utilize your Bilt card benefits, it's crucial to understand these requirements and how gift card purchases fit into the equation.

## Does Buying Amazon Gift Cards Qualify for Bilt Transactions?

### Merchant Coding & Eligibility

The primary factor determining whether an Amazon gift card purchase counts toward Biltâ€™s transaction requirement is **merchant coding**. Credit card networks assign a **Merchant Category Code (MCC)** to each retailer. Bilt Rewards determines eligibility based on these MCC codes.

- Amazon transactions typically fall under general retail or marketplace MCCs.
- Gift card purchases might be categorized as cash equivalents, which may not qualify.
- Some purchases could be coded as "Amazon Reloads," potentially making them ineligible.

### Case Studies from Users

Users have reported mixed experiences regarding Amazon gift card purchases and Bilt transactions:

- **Successful Reports:** Some users claim that buying Amazon gift cards directly from Amazon counted towards their five transactions.
- **Denied Reports:** Others reported that their purchases were flagged as cash-equivalent transactions and did not count.

The inconsistency suggests that success depends on how Amazon categorizes the purchase and how Bilt interprets it.

## Best Practices for Meeting Bilt Transaction Requirements

If Amazon gift card purchases donâ€™t count toward Biltâ€™s requirements, here are alternative strategies:

### Diversify Your Purchases

To ensure you meet Biltâ€™s minimum transaction threshold, consider making various small purchases:

1. **Groceries** - Buy essentials at your local store.
2. **Dining Out** - Use your Bilt card at restaurants.
3. **Transportation** - Pay for gas, Uber, or public transit.
4. **Streaming Services** - Subscribe to Netflix, Spotify, or Hulu.
5. **Retail Stores** - Make small purchases at physical stores.

### Small Transactions Strategy

Instead of relying solely on gift card purchases, spread out small transactions throughout the month:

- Buy a \$1 coffee or snack daily.
- Use Bilt for automatic bill payments.
- Opt for split transactions where allowed.

### Third-Party Gift Card Purchases

Purchasing Amazon gift cards from other retailers (like grocery stores or pharmacies) might result in a different MCC code. Some users have reported success when buying Amazon gift cards from:

- Walgreens
- CVS
- Walmart
- Kroger
- Safeway

This method may increase the chances of your transaction counting toward Bilt requirements.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

If your goal is to maximize Bilt transactions, avoid these pitfalls:

- **Relying Solely on Gift Cards** â€“ Gift card purchases might not always qualify.
- **Not Checking MCC Codes** â€“ Some transactions may be categorized incorrectly.
- **Missing the Minimum Requirement** â€“ Ensure you make at least five transactions monthly.
- **Forgetting Payment Timing** â€“ Make purchases before your billing cycle ends.
- **Using the Wrong Payment Method** â€“ Ensure you use your Bilt credit card, not linked bank accounts.
