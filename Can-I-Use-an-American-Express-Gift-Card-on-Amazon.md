### How to Use an American Express Gift Card on Amazon

#### Step 1: Check the Card Balance
Before using an Amex gift card on Amazon, verify the available balance. You can check the balance by visiting the official American Express website or calling the number on the back of the card.

#### Step 2: Add the Gift Card as a Payment Method
Amazon does not allow direct use of prepaid gift cards, but you can add an Amex gift card as a payment method by following these steps:

1. Log in to your Amazon account.
2. Navigate to **Your Account > Payment options**.
3. Click on **Add a payment method**.
4. Enter the gift card details, including the card number, expiration date, and CVV.
5. Save the payment method.

#### Step 3: Make a Purchase
Once added, you can use the Amex gift card for purchases. However, Amazon does not allow split payments with multiple credit or debit cards, so ensure that your gift card has enough balance for the entire order.
